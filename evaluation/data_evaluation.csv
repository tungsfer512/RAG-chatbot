11,In what contexts is BERT mentioned?,"It is mentioned that for BERT large during training, the input and weight matrix of any matrix multiplication fit neatly into the L2 cache of Ada (but not other Us). The author also mentions that they benchmarked the time for 500 mini-batches for BERT Large during inference (excluding the softmax layer) on the 4x RTX 2080 Ti system. They chose BERT Large inference since, from their experience, this is the deep learning model that stresses the GPU the most."
